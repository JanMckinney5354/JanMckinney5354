## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a data engineer specializing in designing and managing complex ETL workflows using Apache Airflow. This project demonstrates how to build scalable, maintainable data pipelines by leveraging Airflowâ€™s powerful features such as DAGs, task dependencies, and custom scheduling strategies.

At the core of this repository are Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), which define the structure and execution flow of ETL processes. Each DAG represents a complete data pipeline, with tasks encapsulating discrete operations like data extraction, transformation, loading, validation, and reporting. I focus on keeping DAGs modular, readable, and reusable, using Airflow's rich operator ecosystem as well as custom Python operators where necessary.

Task dependencies are managed explicitly to enforce proper execution order, handle upstream failures, and enable conditional logic. Whether itâ€™s ensuring a transformation task only runs after a successful data load, or setting up parallel execution for performance gains, task relationships are carefully designed to support both reliability and efficiency.

I also implement advanced scheduling strategies to match real-world data requirements. Using cron expressions, dynamic triggers, and time-based logic, these workflows can handle everything from hourly ingestion jobs to complex multi-day batch processes. Airflowâ€™s built-in monitoring tools, logging, and alerting help track pipeline health and troubleshoot failures quickly.

This repository serves as a practical reference for building production-grade data pipelines with Apache Airflow. Whether youâ€™re orchestrating large-scale ETL jobs, managing data dependencies, or optimizing pipeline execution, youâ€™ll find robust patterns and real-world examples to guide your work.
